Hi! I am currently a PhD candidate at the College of Computing and Data Science, [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/dniyato/) (FIEEE).

Prior to this, I obtained a BEng degree at [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/), China, under the guidance of Prof. [Kun Wang](http://eda.ee.ucla.edu/people/kun-wang/index.html) (SMIEEE, now a professor with the School of Microelectronics, [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), China) and an MSc degree at the [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/), USA, under the guidance of Prof. [Lei He](http://eda.ee.ucla.edu/) (FIEEE).

My research is primarily centered around the utilization of **Generative AI (GenAI) in intelligent networking**. Our key objective is to explore "[how the intelligent networks can support various AI-Generated Content (AIGC) services]()," and "[how GenAI and Large Language Model (LLM) can be used to improve the performance, security, and reliability of next-generation networking.]()" This involves exploring the integration of various networking methodologies, including Semantic Communications, Blockchain, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Metaverse. Please check our [group](https://jyc5559.github.io/GAINET.github.io/) at NTU for more details!

Our research has been published in prestigious networking journals and conferences, including *IEEE JSAC, IEEE TMC, IEEE COMST, IEEE TII, IEEE IoTJ, ACM FPGA, IEEE ICC, IEEE Globecom*, etc. Also, I serve as the reviewer/TPC member for various journals/conferences, including *IEEE TIFS, IEEE COMST, IEEE TSC, IEEE TCOM, IEEE TNSE, IEEE IoTJ, IEEE Globecom' 24, IEEE/CIC ICCC' 24, IEEE PIMRC' 24, IEEE VTC-Fall' 24, IEEE ICNC' 25, IEEE GIIS' 25, IEEE ICASSP' 25, NeruIPS' 25 SafeGenAi, AAAI' 25 UC* etc.
