Hi! I am currently a researcher at the College of Computing and Data Science, [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Dusit Niyato](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/dniyato/) (FIEEE).

Prior to this, I obtained a BEng degree at [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/), China, under the guidance of Prof. [Kun Wang](http://eda.ee.ucla.edu/people/kun-wang/index.html) (SMIEEE, now a professor with [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), China) and an MSc degree at the [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/), USA, under the guidance of Prof. [Lei He](http://eda.ee.ucla.edu/) (FIEEE).

My research is primarily centered around the utilization of **Generative AI (GenAI) in intelligent networking**. Our key objective is to explore "[how the intelligent networks can support various AI-Generated Content (AIGC) services]()," and "[how GenAI (and LLM) can be used to improve the performance, security, and reliability of next-generation networking.]()" Please check our [group](https://jyc5559.github.io/GAINET.github.io/) at NTU for more details!

Our research has been published in prestigious networking journals and conferences, including *IEEE JSAC, IEEE TMC, IEEE TIFS, IEEE COMST, IEEE INFOCOM, ACM FPGA*, etc. 

I have been recognized with multiple prestigious accolades, including the 2025 IEEE Vehicular Technology Society (VTS) Student Scholarship Award. My research contributions have earned Best Paper Awards at *IEEE WCSP '25*, *IEEE AIoTC '25*, and *IEEE IWCMC '25*, as well as First Place in the IEEE SPCC Student Contest. Additionally, I received the Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis Award from Jiangsu Province, China. As a team leader, I also guided my team to win the Silver Award in the 2024 IEEE ComSoc SocMeta Student Contest and an Honorable Mention in the 2024 IEEE ComSoc Student Competition.
